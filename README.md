Trello Title
We were tasked to make a clone of the website Trello. The major aspects of the website we recreated were rendering list, rendering cards, drag and drop of cards, and adding notes to cards. In addition to the basic functions we were tasked with we also added others. Changing background colors, and changing the name of the board with a double click.
Site Functionality
List Rendering
The functionality of rendering a list is the base of the website. Upon launching the site there is an input field where you can name and create a list. The list is then stored in a database, and can be recalled at anytime. Within the rendered list cards can be added. The ability to delete lists as a whole is available on this feature as well.
Card Rendering
Cards hold the ability to delete themselves as well as the option of logging notes to a database. The cards information is stored on a database, and can be rendered back at anytime. Cards can also be moved using the drag and drop feature.
Drag and Drop
The ability to drag cards from lists and drop them in other lists were added as well. This feature is utilized by selecting a card by clicking on it, holding the click while moving hte card to the new list, and releasing the click to drop it on the new list.



Notes Rendering
Once a comment icon is clicked a modal is rendered. It has an input field and a save button. Once the note is saved to the page it is saved to a database and can be rendered below the the input field.
